# üß† Human Resources EDA Project

This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a Human Resources dataset, aiming to uncover patterns, trends, and factors that might influence employee attrition, satisfaction, and performance.

## üìÅ Dataset Information

The dataset contains **1,740 employee records**, with features related to demographics, job role, income, satisfaction levels, and more.

Key columns include:

- Age, Gender, Marital Status
- Department, JobRole, BusinessTravel
- Monthly Income, Hourly Rate, Daily Rate
- Job Satisfaction, Environment Satisfaction, Work-Life Balance
- Total Working Years, Years at Company, Years in Current Role
- Attrition (Yes/No)

---

## üìä Project Goals

- Understand workforce demographics and job distribution
- Investigate salary trends and financial benefits
- Analyze work satisfaction, promotion rates, and attrition
- Explore correlations between job level, salary, and experience
- Identify insights to improve employee retention and HR strategies

---

## üìå Key Insights

- Average employee age: **~37 years**, with most in mid-career stages  
- **Average monthly income**: ~10,287 units  
- Most employees rate satisfaction metrics around **3 (moderate)**  
- Employees who left the company had **lower average incomes and were younger**  
- **Job level and total working years** show strong correlation with income

## üîç Problem Statement
Human Resources (HR) departments are under increasing pressure to make data-informed decisions to retain top talent and improve workplace satisfaction. High attrition rates can lead to significant productivity and financial losses. This project explores key employee attributes ‚Äî such as satisfaction, compensation, and career growth ‚Äî to help HR leaders identify underlying patterns behind employee turnover and dissatisfaction.

The goal is to turn raw HR data into actionable insights that can support smarter workforce strategies.

## üìö Key Learnings
Throughout this project, I gained hands-on experience in:
‚Ä¢	Cleaning and analyzing real-world HR datasets with multiple categorical and numerical features
‚Ä¢	Visualizing trends to reveal hidden correlations (e.g., between job level and income, attrition and satisfaction)
‚Ä¢	Interpreting insights from a business-first perspective to drive decisions, not just charts
‚Ä¢	Enhancing storytelling techniques to present data clearly and meaningfully
‚Ä¢	Practicing domain understanding in workforce analytics and HR KPIs

## ‚è≥ What I Would Improve With More Time
If I had more time or access to a richer dataset, I would:
‚Ä¢	Develop a predictive model to forecast attrition risk based on satisfaction and compensation variables
‚Ä¢	Build an interactive dashboard (e.g., Power BI or Streamlit) for HR professionals to monitor key metrics
‚Ä¢	Apply NLP on employee feedback (if available) to assess qualitative insights on culture and morale
‚Ä¢	Incorporate industry benchmarks to compare employee compensation and growth trends

## üó∫Ô∏è Project Roadmap.

This project followed a structured workflow:
 1.	**Business Understanding:** Defined project objectives from an HR perspective: employee retention and satisfaction
 2.	**Data Understanding:** Explored and summarized the dataset; identified missing or imbalanced values
 3.	**Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Renamed columns, formatted values, handled missing data, and encoded categorical features
 4.	**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Created comparative visualizations by gender, department, attrition status, satisfaction level, etc.
 5.	**Insight Summary:** Highlighted trends and anomalies; included recommendations for HR strategies
 6.	**Future Work Planning:** Outlined next steps for modeling, dashboarding, and improving business value
